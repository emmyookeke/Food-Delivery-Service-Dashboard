# Food Delivery Service Dashboard
# Overview
The Food Delivery Service Dashboard project aims to provide comprehensive insights into the performance and operations of a food delivery service. Despite the advancements in technology, there are still instances where warm meals, such as soup, are delivered cold, or cold meals, like ice cream, are delivered warm due to factors like time and distance of delivery. To address this issue, the project proposes extending food delivery services to food trucks equipped to deliver meals at the desired temperature directly to the customer.

The purpose of this project is to analyze the main factors that drive customers to use this service. The analysis is based on 12 months of survey data collected from customers.

# Objective
The main objective of the Food Delivery Power BI project is to:

Understand the factors influencing customer preferences and decisions regarding temperature-controlled food delivery services.
Identify key insights and trends from the 12-month survey data to inform business strategies and decision-making.
Visualize survey data and analysis results in an interactive and insightful manner using Power BI dashboards and reports.

# Data Source
Survey Data: The project utilizes 12 months of survey data collected from customers who have used temperature-controlled food delivery services.
Data Description: The survey data includes information on customer preferences, delivery experiences, satisfaction levels, food preferences, and other relevant factors.
